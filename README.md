# Cichlid_website
website script linked to CICHLID_TRACKINGV4 and DARWIN_TRACKINGV1 databases

To deploy: 
  - connection details within the Cichlid_dbV4.json and Darwin_dbV1.json have to be completed,
  - within Cichlid.py script: 
      - the python3 prompt has to be set,
      - the path to Cichlid_dbV4.json and Darwin_dbV1.json set may need to be set
      
The website requests the user to choose the database to query. Then the navigation can be done by menu, direct queries or a mix of both.
